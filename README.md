Included in this repository is a vignette providing detailed installation instructions for the `simpleSCDE` package. A summary of available methods is also included in the vignette, in addition to example commands that can be run on your own machine.

## Included Data

The `simpleSCDE` package includes large planarian data sets from both Fincher et al and Scimone et al.
