Description: A simplified method of cell data wrangling and single-cell differential expression 
    analysis in R. It is intended for use by those studying or researching the biological sciences
    with limited computer science experience. Included is the ability to manipulate large data frames 
    and label cell groupings positive or negative for customizable gene populations. Generated label 
    vectors are utilized during single-cell differential expression testing as groups between which 
    differential expression can be assessed.
